# ACNH Music Collection Tracker
My partner and I love to play Animal Crossing together every morning. Recently we decided to collect all of the songs in the game, only to find that there are over 100! We got tired of running to the house everyday to check our stereos so I made this app to help us keep track of what we have!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ACNH API

I started by using the Animal Crossing API to create new DOM elements with checkboxes. When checked, the data is kept in local storage. The songs from the newest update were no tin the API, so I created a separate function and manually copied the links from Nookipedia.

## Optimizations

I have not done anything to make this app pretty. It keeps it loading quickly as it is really only needed as a simple tool. I did update it to add spacing to the checkboxes as they were a bit close together and difficult to click on mobile.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a good refresher on using local storage and DOM manipulation. 



Also check out other projects of mine like this one! I used the same API for them.
