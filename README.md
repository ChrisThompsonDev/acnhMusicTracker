# ACNH Music Collection Tracker
My partner and I love to play Animal Crossing together every morning. Recently we decided to collect all of the songs in the game, only to find that there are over 100! We got tired of running to the house everyday to check our stereos so I made this app to help us keep track of what we have! 

Over time, we started finding it difficult to keep track of other things, so now this tool has been upgraded to include Fossils and Art as well. Media Queries and more collections to come! I've only focused on mobile layout so far because that is the only way that we use this.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ACNH API

I started by using the Animal Crossing API to create new DOM elements with checkboxes. When checked, the data is kept in local storage. The songs from the newest update were not in the API, so I created a separate factory and manually copied the links from Nookipedia.

## Optimizations

I have added a lot of features to this over time. It started as simble text and checkboxes. It now has images, nicer formatting, background changes upon selection and a progress bar!

## Lessons Learned:

This was a good refresher on using local storage and DOM manipulation. Every project is lesson learned in CSS!
